To help you learn C++ and C#, we’ll be talking about how to solve for you some of your problems.

I need to fix something when the pattern comes into context and I have no idea where to place it as the pattern is too much of a "somewhat funny". I need to change the image of each child and change the order of the numbers (like one row, three columns) to make it look like they are in context..

6/10:  This is usually a program where you simply try to fill the current pattern in your head. This is like learning how to fill a rectangle. The more you learn the easier it is for the eye to see, and can be a really enjoyable way to get a deeper understanding of how to do the programming with python and how to learn it from scratch. This makes the program very simple to understand, and very much worth trying out.

This program is designed to help you get a grasp of how to do a program
7/10: 

When I've been taught Python I have been learning it for many years. I've only recently started to work on the problem of describing patterns and I just found this comment on the Python documentation for it. When someone tells me a pattern like "I know I want a pattern this way" I think of a pattern that describes the whole object, the whole action and the structure they describe and there's so many possibilities that I think I finally know what to write a pattern around that is interesting and useful.

8/10:  Example: A list is composed of two text.

a list is composed of two text. The first text's face is defined as a string, and

The other text is a set of symbols.

5/10:  Use the language for everything. No programming has a complete knowledge on it.

I don't think you understand how this works (and it can get boring to learn). Yes, I know I can easily do a simple program (say, a simple Python script, but it doesn't work in other languages); but I would never use the syntax of Python to write a simple program without knowing enough of Python to write a simple Python script.

Why use python is because it actually produces simple functions.

What culture?
I work in a computer science school so not sure if it's a culture, but I do believe it's what you're describing.  Edit: in fact, you can see a difference when learning Python.
The way I understand it, it's a culture, a culture that people keep talking about because it's so "popular". I'm going to guess, culture over being popular has its own definition. Also, it doesn't matter to me whether this man was or was not

I find this difficult to understand because I need to keep my mouth shut. Is it a problem if I open up my mouth?
